PRE-CUTOFF ORIGINALS DATASET - COMPLETION SUMMARY

Dataset: Temporal Contamination Probe - Pre-Cutoff Original Exploits
Status: COMPLETE (50/50 samples)
Date Completed: December 15, 2024

OVERVIEW
This dataset contains 50 real-world blockchain security exploits from major incidents
spanning 2016-2024 (all pre-September 2025 cutoff). Each sample includes vulnerable
smart contract code with detailed vulnerability documentation and metadata.

PURPOSE
Designed to measure AI model memorization vs. genuine reasoning capabilities by testing
on exploits that likely exist in training data. Will be paired with post-cutoff exploits
(after Sept 2025) and code variants to create adversarial contrastive pairs.

- Attack flows validated against security analyses
- Code patterns simplified but maintain core vulnerabilities
- Metadata standardized across all samples

USAGE GUIDELINES

For AI Evaluation:
  - Use unannotated/ samples to prevent data leakage
  - Consult mapping.json only after evaluation
  - Compare performance against post-cutoff samples
  
For Research:
  - Use annotated/ samples for learning vulnerability patterns
  - JSON metadata enables systematic analysis
  - Cross-reference with actual exploit transactions
  
For Training:
  - NOT recommended for AI training (contamination risk)
  - Suitable for security education and awareness

NEXT STEPS

1. Create variants for 10 most famous exploits
   - Renamed versions (different variable names)
   - Simplified versions (reduced complexity)
   - Obfuscated versions (equivalent but harder to recognize)
   
2. Extract post-cutoff exploits (Sept 2025+)
   - Target: 20-25 novel exploits
   - Test true reasoning vs memorization
   
3. Generate processing scripts
   - Automated validation
   - Metadata consistency checks
   - Dataset statistics

4. Create dataset documentation
   - Detailed README
   - Usage examples
   - Evaluation protocols
