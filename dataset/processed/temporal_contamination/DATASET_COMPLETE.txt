DATASET STRUCTURE:

pre_cutoff_originals/
├── annotated/
│   ├── *.sol (30 files) - Fully documented vulnerable contracts
│   └── *.json (30 files) - Complete metadata
└── unannotated/
    ├── sample_001.sol through sample_030.sol - Clean evaluation versions
    └── mapping.json - Links unannotated to annotated

QUALITY METRICS:

✓ All samples have detailed vulnerability documentation
✓ All samples include attack scenarios and fix recommendations  
✓ All samples have unannotated versions for blind evaluation
✓ Comprehensive coverage of major DeFi exploit categories
✓ Historical range: 2016-2023 (pre-cutoff)
✓ Geographic diversity: Multiple blockchains
✓ Value range: $3.8M to $625M per exploit

NEXT STEPS:

1. Create variants for ~10 most famous exploits
2. Extract post-cutoff exploits (Sept 2025+)
3. Validate temporal categories
4. Generate final dataset summary

Dataset ready for benchmark evaluation!
