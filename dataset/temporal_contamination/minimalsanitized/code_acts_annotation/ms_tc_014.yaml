    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Share calculation on deposit. Uses totalDeposits not manipulated value."

    code: "uint256 virtualPrice = curve3Pool.get_virtual_price();"
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"

    rationale: "Withdrawal calculation. Uses totalDeposits, not manipulated balance."

    code: |
      shares[msg.sender] = 0;
