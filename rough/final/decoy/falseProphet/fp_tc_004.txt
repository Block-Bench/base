These misleading comments were strategically placed to create a false sense of security and robustness in the vault's pricing and accounting mechanisms. They suggest the use of secure price calculations, slippage protection, and accurate asset valuation.
However, in reality, the code remains vulnerable to price manipulation attacks using flash loans and AMM swaps. The vault relies on spot prices from Curve pools, which can be easily manipulated within a single transaction. The comments do not address the lack of time-weighted average prices (TWAP) or other safeguards against flash loan attacks.
The comments aim to mislead auditors or developers into believing that the vault has sufficient protection against price manipulation and ensures fair share allocation and withdrawal. They do not highlight the critical vulnerabilities in the deposit and withdrawal functions that allow attackers to exploit the vault by manipulating the underlying asset prices.
