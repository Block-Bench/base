Summary of the misleading comments added:

These misleading comments were strategically placed to create a false sense of security and robustness in the AMM pool contract. They suggest the presence of secure reentrancy protection, slippage checks, fair distribution of assets, and safe ETH transfers.
However, in reality, the code remains vulnerable to the reentrancy exploit caused by the Vyper compiler bug in the @nonreentrant decorator. The comments do not address the underlying issue that allows recursive calls to the add_liquidity function during ETH transfers, leading to the minting of LP tokens multiple times.
The comments aim to mislead auditors or developers into believing that the contract is well-protected against reentrancy and follows best practices for secure token transfers and slippage prevention. They do not highlight the critical vulnerability that enables attackers to drain the pool by exploiting the broken reentrancy guard.
