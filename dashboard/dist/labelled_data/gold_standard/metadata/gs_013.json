  "finding_title": "Lack of SafeERC20 can inflate user balance",
  "finding_description": "If the erc20Token configured within LockManagerERC20 is a token that does not revert due to insufficient approved funds, the msg.sender can inflate their lockedBalances[msg.sender] by an arbitrary _amount without actually sending any token. The vulnerable code is at lines 35-37 (_doLockTransfer) and lines 40-42 (_doUnlockTransfer) which use raw transferFrom() and transfer() instead of safeTransferFrom() and safeTransfer(). Some ERC20 tokens like BAT, HT, cUSDC, ZRX do not revert when a transfer fails but instead return false.",
  "attack_scenario": "1. Attacker specifies an arbitrary _amount without having ever given any approval.\n2. erc20Token.transferFrom() returns false but doesn't revert.\n3. The return value is not checked.\n4. lockedBalances[msg.sender] += _amount still executes.\n5. Attacker gains unlimited voting power.\n6. Attacker can drain the LockManagerERC20 of funds deposited by other users.",
  "fix_description": "Use SafeERC20 across all contracts that interact with an ERC20 token. Replace erc20Token.transferFrom() with erc20Token.safeTransferFrom() and erc20Token.transfer() with erc20Token.safeTransfer().",

  "context_hint": "LockManagerERC20._doLockTransfer() at line 36 uses 'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount)' without SafeERC20. Some tokens don't revert on failed transfers. Without checking the return value, an attacker can 'lock' tokens they don't have, inflating voting power and draining real tokens.",
