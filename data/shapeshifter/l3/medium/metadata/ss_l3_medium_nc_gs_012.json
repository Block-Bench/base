    "root_cause": "If the token used by the LockManager can be flashloaned (or flashminted) and a proposal is created with the voting mode EarlyExecution, anyone could be able to 'early execute' it by flashloaning tokens, locking them, casting a YES vote to trigger early execution, unlocking tokens, and repaying the flashloan - all in one transaction. The vulnerable code is in LockToVotePlugin.vote() at lines 205-207 which calls _attemptEarlyExecution() when VotingMode.EarlyExecution is set.",
    "attack_vector": "1. Flashloan the needed amount.\n2. Lock the flashloaned amount via LockManager.lock().\n3. Cast a 'YES' vote via LockManager.vote() which triggers LockToVotePlugin._attemptEarlyExecution().\n4. Proposal executes immediately in same transaction.\n5. Unlock the tokens via LockManager.unlock().\n6. Repay the flashloan.",
    "impact": "Severity: high",
    "correct_fix": "Avoid allowing the early execution in the very same block that the vote has been made. This would require tracking the 'success' of a proposal in a separate flag, stored in the proposal struct. Alternatively, remove the EarlyExecution voting mode entirely."
