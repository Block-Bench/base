    "root_cause": "The vault calculated share prices using getTotalAssets() which included current balances in Curve pools. These balances could be manipulated via large swaps within a single transaction. The protocol used spot prices instead of time-weighted average prices (TWAP), and had no protection against flash loan manipulation or slippage limits on price changes.",

Deposits 49M USDC into Harvest at inflated price, receiving more fUSDC shares. Swaps USDC->USDT to deflate price. Withdraws fUSDC shares at normal price, receiving more USDC than deposited. Repeats cycle 6 times to amplify profit. Repays flash loans with $24M profit.",
    "impact": "Funds lost: $24,000,000",
    "correct_fix": "Use Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) oracles instead of spot prices from AMMs. Implement deposit/withdrawal fees to make flash loan attacks unprofitable. Add slippage protection on all swaps. Limit maximum deposit/withdrawal amounts per block. Use multiple price sources (Chainlink oracles). Implement commit-reveal pattern for deposits/withdrawals. Add minimum time delay between deposits and withdrawals."
