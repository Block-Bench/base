This is achieved by an external call \nfrom a secure smart contract \"A\" invoking the fallback() function in the attacker's contract.\n\nThrough this exploit, the attacker gains the ability to execute code within the fallback() function\nagainst a target contract \"B,\" which is indirectly related to contract \"A.\" Contract \"B\" derives\nthe price of the LP token from Contract \"A,\" making it susceptible to manipulation and unintended price changes\nthrough the reentrancy attack.",
