The order of operations can affect the result due to integer truncation.\n\nIn the Miscalculation contract, the function price performs the division before the\nmultiplication (price / 100) * discount. Due to the fact that Solidity truncates integers\nwhen dividing, the result of price / 100 will be 0 if the price is less than 100. \nThis causes the result of the multiplication to be 0 as well.\n\nOn the other hand, in the Calculation contract, the function price performs the multiplication\nbefore the division (price * discount) / 100. This way, the result will be correct as the multiplication\ndoesn't get truncated, only the final result does.",
