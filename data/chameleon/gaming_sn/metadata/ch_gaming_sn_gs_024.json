    "root_cause": "LiquidityBuffer.getControlledBalance() sums balances of managers with isActive == true only. If an admin deactivates a manager via updatePositionManager()/togglePositionManagerStatus() before evacuating funds, any residual underlying on that manager is excluded from the total, causing under-reporting. Moreover, withdrawals from inactive managers are blocked (_withdrawETHFromManager and onlyPositionManagerContract both require the manager to be active), so the funds remain inaccessible until the manager is reactivated.",
    "attack_vector": "1. Position manager 0 has 1000 ETH allocated to it in Aave\n2. Admin calls togglePositionManagerStatus(0) to deactivate manager 0 without first withdrawing funds\n3. getControlledBalance() now returns a value that is 1000 ETH less than the actual protocol holdings\n4. _withdrawETHFromManager(0, amount) reverts with LiquidityBuffer__ManagerInactive()\n5. The 1000 ETH is effectively locked and invisible to the protocol accounting until admin reactivates the manager",
    "impact": "Severity: medium",
    "correct_fix": "Check underlying balance before deactivation and use a dedicated forceDeactivate() if it's not zero. This was fixed in commit 93280383c0858c559270ceaec6f5d04f9be0a8e7."
