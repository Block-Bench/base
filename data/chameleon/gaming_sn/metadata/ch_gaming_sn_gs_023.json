If the current default manager is deactivated via LiquidityBuffer.updatePositionManager()/togglePositionManagerStatus() without first switching defaultManagerId or disabling auto-allocation, _allocateETHToManager(defaultManagerId, \u2026) reverts with LiquidityBuffer__ManagerInactive(). This can unexpectedly block allocation flows.",
