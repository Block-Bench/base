    "root_cause": "The currentTokenSupply() function at LockToVotePlugin line 249-251 returns IERC20(lockManager.token()).totalSupply(). This is used in threshold checks (isMinVotingPowerReached, isMinApprovalReached). For tokens like ERC4626 shares, flash-mintable tokens (DAI, WETH), or tokens with permissionless minting, attackers can manipulate totalSupply to skew voting thresholds. This is especially impactful during the last block of a proposal.",
    "attack_vector": "1. A proposal is close to passing based on participation threshold.\n2. Attacker flash-mints large amount of tokens (e.g., via ERC4626 vault deposit).\n3. currentTokenSupply() returns inflated totalSupply.\n4. isMinVotingPowerReached() calculates: votes / inflatedSupply.\n5. Participation ratio appears lower than required.\n6. Proposal that should pass now fails.\n7. Attacker burns/withdraws the tokens in same transaction.",
    "impact": "Severity: medium",
    "correct_fix": "Avoid using currentTotalSupply where it can be skewed. Consider recording totalSupply at proposal creation time. Document token compatibility requirements. Use conservative figures if supply changes significantly."
