    "root_cause": "When a wallet is behind a checkpointer and a chained signature is used with bit 6 (checkpointer usage flag) set to zero, BaseSig.recover skips the checkpointer validation block (BaseSig.sol:88-106). This leaves _checkpointer and snapshot unset (zero-valued). In recoverChained, the checkpointer is ignored, and the signature validation passes even if the checkpointer should be enforced. The final validation succeeds because snapshot.imageHash == bytes32(0) as the checkpointer is ignored.",
    "attack_vector": "An evicted signer can sign a payload valid under stale wallet configuration and bypass checkpointer validation. PoC: Add test case to BaseSigTest and run forge test --match-test test_PoC_checkpointer_bypass. The test constructs a chained signature with checkpointer disabled, mocks the checkpointer response, and asserts successful recovery with correct image hash.",
