    "root_cause": "The lock() function intends to lock the user's entire approved balance, but this will fail for the most common case: Most users give contracts they interact with an unlimited allowance by setting it to type(uint256).max. The _incomingTokenBalance() function at line 32 returns just 'erc20Token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this))' which would be type(uint256).max for unlimited approvals. The lock() function then attempts to transfer this impossible amount.",
    "attack_vector": "1. User approves LockManager with unlimited allowance: approve(lockManager, type(uint256).max).\n2. User calls lock() without specifying an amount.\n3. _incomingTokenBalance() returns type(uint256).max.\n4. _doLockTransfer attempts to transfer type(uint256).max tokens.\n5. Transaction reverts because user doesn't have that many tokens.\n6. User cannot use the standard lock() function.",
