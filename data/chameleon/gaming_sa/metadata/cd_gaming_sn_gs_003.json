    "root_cause": "in the `GaugeV2` contract, if the contract was emergency activated, users calling `emergencyWithdraw()` will lose all past accrued rewards that didn\u2019t have `updateReward()` called on it previously for a user to earn rewards, he gets his mappings updated here modifier updateReward(address account) { rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken(); lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable(); if (account != address(0)) { rewards[account] = earned(account); userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] = rewardPerTokenStored; } _; } as we see above, rewards mapping is registered as the return data from `earned()`, and when we look at it we see function earned(address account) public view returns (uint256) { rewards[account] + _balanceOf(account) * (rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]) / 1e18; } we see that it returns old rewards + current balance of the user multiplied by the rewardPerToken (abstractly) so what happen will be as follows: 1. User stake 100e18 tokens 2. emergency activated 3. he had already earnt before the emergency 10e18 tokens not registered on his rewards mapping since he didn\u2019t call deposit/withdraw/getRewards to update his rewards 4. call emergencyWithdraw and his balance now is 0. 5. now earned() function return 0 rewards since his balance is 0 * rewardPerToken = 0 also the left-off rewards tokens are stuck in the contract forever. Impact: Loss of rewards for users and stuck reward tokens in the contract",
