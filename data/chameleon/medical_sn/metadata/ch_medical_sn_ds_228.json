    "correct_fix": "Consider minting a minimal amount of pool tokens during the first deposit \nand sending them to zero address, this increases the cost of the attack. \nUniswap V2 solved this problem by sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address. \nThe same can be done in this case i.e. when totalSupply() == 0, \nsend the first min liquidity LP tokens to the zero address to enable share dilution."
