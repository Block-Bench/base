However, the constant product invariant check still used the old 1000 scale (reserve0 * reserve1 * 1000^2) instead of the new scale (reserve0 * reserve1 * 10000^2). This created a 100x mismatch allowing K to inflate after swaps.",
    "attack_vector": "1) Attacker deposited tokens into Uranium WBNB/BUSD pool. 2) Executed swap with amount0In. 3) K validation: left side (balance * 10000) vs right side (reserve * 1000^2) created 100x discrepancy. 4) Check passed even though K actually increased 100x. 5) Swapped back in opposite direction with even more inflated K. 6) Each swap cycle further inflated the constant product. 7) After 5-10 iterations, attacker drained $50M by extracting more tokens than deposited. Pool became completely imbalanced.",
