    "root_cause": "As we can see, the `GovernanceHYBR::deposit` function first deposits the HYBR into the votingEscrow before calculating and minting shares. This will deposit the tokens first increasing the `totalAssets()` and the new `totalAssets()` will be used in `shares = calculateShares(amount)`. This results in incorrect calculation of shares for the users because their deposits are treated as rewards and they are minted shares with the new rate and will suffer slippage from their own tokens. Example: - Initially Bob has a deposit of 100 gHYBR : 100 HYBR, ie.. 1:1 shares to asset ratio - Alice also enter with 100 assets(HYBR), - In an ideal condition, Alice is expected to recieve 100 shares because the ratio is 1:1 at the time of deposit - but because deposit is done first before calculating shares, - Alice will get, shares = 100 * 100 / (100 +100) i.e. only 50 shares Impact Loss of assets for users by minting less shares.",
