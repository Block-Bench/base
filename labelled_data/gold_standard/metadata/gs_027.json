  "finding_title": "Missing freshness check on oracle data in Staking.totalControlled() enables stale-rate arbitrage",
  "finding_description": "Staking.totalControlled() derives the mETH/ETH exchange rate inputs from oracle.latestRecord() without validating the record timestamp. If the oracle lags significant state changes (e.g., validator rewards or slashing), the resulting rate becomes stale. An attacker can exploit this by timing mint/burn operations against outdated totals: redeeming mETH for excess ETH when a slashing is not yet reflected (overstated totalControlled()), or depositing ETH to mint excess mETH when recent rewards are not yet reflected (understated totalControlled()), extracting value from other users.",
  "attack_scenario": "Slashing scenario:\n1. Validators are slashed, reducing the actual ETH controlled by the protocol\n2. Oracle has not yet updated to reflect the slashing\n3. totalControlled() returns the old (higher) value\n4. Attacker calls unstakeRequest() and receives more ETH per mETH than they should\n5. Other users bear the loss when the oracle updates\n\nReward scenario:\n1. Validators earn significant rewards\n2. Oracle has not yet updated to reflect the new rewards\n3. totalControlled() returns the old (lower) value\n4. Attacker calls stake() and receives more mETH per ETH than they should\n5. The mETH is worth more once the oracle updates",
  "fix_description": "Enforce freshness validation for oracle records when minting or burning mETH. The Oracle.latestRecord() function has no sanity checks - it simply returns _records[_records.length - 1]. The validations should be implemented on the caller side, specifically in the Staking.totalControlled() function.",
  "call_flow": "stake()/unstakeRequest() -> ethToMETH()/mETHToETH() -> totalControlled() -> oracle.latestRecord() -> returns potentially stale data -> incorrect exchange rate calculation",
  "context_hint": "The totalControlled() function uses oracle.latestRecord() to get validator balances without checking how recent the record is. If the oracle is stale (hasn't updated after slashing or rewards), the exchange rate will be incorrect, allowing arbitrage.",
