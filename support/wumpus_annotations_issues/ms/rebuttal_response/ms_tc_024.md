# Rebuttal Response: ms_tc_024 — Oracle Read & Use Correctness

## 1. Independent Review
- **Contract/Annotation/Metadata:** Alignment across all axes is excellent. The labeling of Code Act types and security functions shows high discipline—the dual ROOT_CAUSE (oracle definition and consumption) is justified due to the exploit depending on both phases distinctly.
- No propagation/context inflation. BENIGN/PREREQ boundaries are respected.

## 2. Review and Synthesis
- No issues found in any causal designation or act separation.

## 3. Conclusion
- ✅ Fully concur—this is a reference model for strict taxonomy and label economy in oracle-related exploits.

---
**Summary:**
No errors or taxonomy drift detected; high confidence in the annotation’s precision and value as a training/benchmark example.
