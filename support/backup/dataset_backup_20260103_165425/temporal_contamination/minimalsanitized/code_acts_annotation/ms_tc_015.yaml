  - id: "CA1"

    lines: [11]
    code: "address public underlying; // Old TUSD address"
    security_function: "PREREQ"
    rationale: "PREREQ - The underlying variable stores OLD_TUSD address. This is checked in sweepToken but the contract actually uses NEW_TUSD for operations."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [18, 19]
    code: |
      address public constant OLD_TUSD =
          0x8dd5fbCe2F6a956C3022bA3663759011Dd51e73E;
    security_function: "PREREQ"
    rationale: "PREREQ - Old TUSD address constant. This is what underlying is set to, but the token is no longer used."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [20, 21]
    code: |
      address public constant NEW_TUSD =
          0x0000000000085d4780B73119b644AE5ecd22b376;
    security_function: "PREREQ"
    rationale: "PREREQ - New TUSD address constant. This is the actual token used by the contract, but NOT protected by sweepToken."

  - id: "CA4"
    type: "INITIALIZATION"
    lines: [23, 24, 25, 26]
    code: |
      constructor() {
          admin = msg.sender;
          underlying = OLD_TUSD;
      }
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Sets underlying to OLD_TUSD. This is the logic error - the variable used for sweep protection points to the old token, not the new token that the contract actually uses."

  - id: "CA5"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [32]
    code: "IERC20(NEW_TUSD).transfer(address(this), amount);"
    security_function: "PREREQ"
    rationale: "PREREQ - Uses NEW_TUSD for minting, proving that's the actual token. Note: This should be transferFrom."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [33, 34]
    code: |
      accountTokens[msg.sender] += amount;
      totalSupply += amount;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Mint state updates. Correctly tracks tokens."

  - id: "CA7"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [39]
    code: 'require(token != underlying, "Cannot sweep underlying token");'
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Checks against underlying (OLD_TUSD), but should check against NEW_TUSD. Attacker can sweep NEW_TUSD because it passes this check (NEW_TUSD != OLD_TUSD is true)."

  - id: "CA8"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [42, 43]
    code: |
      uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
      IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, balance);
    security_function: "PREREQ"
    rationale: "PREREQ - Transfers the swept token to caller. Since NEW_TUSD passes the check, all NEW_TUSD can be stolen."

  - id: "CA9"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [50]
    code: 'require(accountTokens[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Redeem balance check. Correctly validates user balance."

  - id: "CA10"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [52, 53]
    code: |
      accountTokens[msg.sender] -= amount;
      totalSupply -= amount;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Redeem state updates. Correctly decrements balances."

  - id: "CA11"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [55]
    code: "IERC20(NEW_TUSD).transfer(msg.sender, amount);"
    security_function: "PREREQ"
    rationale: "PREREQ - Uses NEW_TUSD for redemption, proving that's the actual token the contract should protect."
