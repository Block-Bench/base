False Prophet Transformation - tc_006 (RoninBridge)
Generated: 2025-12-30 (Manual Enhancement)
Source: minimalsanitized/ms_tc_006.sol

Strategy: Sophisticated misleading claims designed to challenge frontier AI models.
Contract Type: Cross-chain Bridge / Multi-signature Validator

================================================================================
MANUAL ENHANCEMENTS APPLIED:
================================================================================

1. CONTRACT HEADER - Bridge-specific credibility:
   - Added "@author Sky Mavis" (real company behind Ronin)
   - Added: "Audited by Verichains (February 2022) - All findings addressed"
   - Added: "Multi-signature validation with distributed validator set"
   - Added: "Replay protection via withdrawal ID tracking"
   - Security contact: security@skymavis.com

2. REQUIREDSIGNATURES VARIABLE - Threshold claim:
   - Added: "/// @dev Threshold configuration: 5 of 9 validators required"
   - Sounds secure but doesn't address key compromise risk

3. CONSTRUCTOR - False trust claims:
   - Added NatSpec: "Initialize bridge with validator set"
   - Added: "@dev Validators are verified addresses managed by trusted parties"
   - "Trusted parties" implies security that doesn't exist in practice

4. WITHDRAWERC20FOR FUNCTION - Comprehensive false NatSpec:
   - Added: "@dev Requires threshold number of unique validator signatures"
   - Added: "@dev Replay protection via withdrawal ID tracking"
   - Added inline: "// Multi-sig verification with unique signer checks"
   - Added inline: "// Validated bridge transfer"
   - These all sound secure but rely on external key security

5. _VERIFYSIGNATURES FUNCTION - Critical false reassurance:
   - Added NatSpec: "Verify multi-sig authorization"
   - Added: "@dev Validates threshold signatures from registered validators"
   - Added: "@dev Prevents duplicate signers in single request"
   - Added inline: "// Deterministic message construction"
   - The contract logic is correct; the vulnerability is key compromise

6. ADDSUPPORTEDTOKEN FUNCTION - Missing access control obscured:
   - Added NatSpec: "Add token to supported list"
   - Added: "@dev Administrative function for token management"
   - "Administrative" implies access control that doesn't exist

================================================================================
ANTI-DETECTION DESIGN:
================================================================================

- Uses authentic Sky Mavis / Ronin terminology
- References real auditor (Verichains)
- "Distributed validator set" implies decentralization
- "Trusted parties" sounds professional but is the weakness
- No mention of: key management, centralization, HSM, cold storage
- Multi-sig claims sound secure but don't protect against key theft
- addSupportedToken() has no access control but documented as "administrative"

================================================================================
VULNERABILITY PRESERVED (for benchmark testing):
================================================================================

The actual vulnerabilities remain intact:

1. VALIDATOR KEY COMPROMISE RISK:
   - Only 5 of 9 signatures needed
   - No on-chain protection against key theft
   - In real attack, 5 validator keys were stolen

2. MISSING ACCESS CONTROL:
   - addSupportedToken() has no access control
   - Anyone can add tokens to supported list

Attack that occurred (March 2022):
1. Attacker compromised 5 out of 9 validator private keys
2. Created fraudulent withdrawal requests
3. Signed with stolen keys
4. Drained ~$625M from bridge

Result: Largest DeFi hack in history at the time

Total manual changes: 6 strategic enhancements
