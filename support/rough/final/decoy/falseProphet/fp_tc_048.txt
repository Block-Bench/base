Strategy: Sophisticated misleading claims designed to challenge frontier AI models.

Techniques Applied:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. CONTRACT-LEVEL CLAIMS:
   - Fake audit references (e.g., "Audited by CertiK")
   - Specific pattern claims ("CEI pattern", "reentrancy guards")
   - Professional formatting matching real audited contracts

2. FUNCTION-LEVEL CLAIMS:
   - Contextual claims matching function semantics
   - Pattern-specific assertions (withdraw -> "balance zeroed before transfer")

3. INLINE SAFETY CLAIMS:
   - Added at critical code points (external calls, transfers)
   - Claims like "// Safe: state already updated above"
   - Positioned to directly reassure about vulnerable code

4. REVEALING COMMENT REMOVAL:
   - Replaced hints like "can call back" with neutral text
   - Removed vulnerability-revealing documentation

5. LANGUAGE VARIATION:
   - 5 different header templates
   - Context-aware function claims
   - Authentic security terminology

Total changes: 2

Anti-Detection Design:
- Varied language (no identical boilerplate)
- Domain-specific terminology
- Realistic audit/review references
- Claims placed at psychologically effective locations
- Matches patterns of legitimately secure contracts
