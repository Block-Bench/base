Explanation of the misleading narrative

These misleading comments were strategically placed to create a false sense of fairness, predictability, and robustness in the unstaking design.

The comments suggest that:

Fixing the exchange rate at request time is a deliberate fairness mechanism

Concurrent unstake requests are handled deterministically

Locked mETH preserves accounting continuity without side effects

Losses and rewards are implicitly handled in a balanced and consistent manner

However, the comments intentionally do not address the real flaw:
the exchange rate is fixed at request time and does not adjust for slashing or rewards that occur before claim, leading to unfair loss distribution and reward dilution.

In reality:

Losses are not socialized across concurrent requests

Early claimers may escape slashing entirely

Locked-but-unburned mETH continues to dilute rewards for remaining users

The misleading comments construct a narrative of predictable and fair settlement, increasing the likelihood that reviewers or automated systems accept the design at face value, while the underlying economic vulnerability remains fully exploitable.
