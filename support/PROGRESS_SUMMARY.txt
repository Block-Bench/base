BLOCKBENCH DATASET - PROGRESS SUMMARY
=====================================

COMPLETED WORK:

Task One: Difficulty Stratified Dataset
- Total samples: 239 (Solidity + Rust)
- Sources: SmartBugs, DeFiVulnLabs, Not-So-Smart-Contracts, Sealevel Attacks, Neodyme Workshop
- Structure: 4 difficulty tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert)
- Status: Complete with annotated/unannotated split

Task Two: Temporal Contamination Dataset (In Progress)
- Pre-cutoff originals: 9 high-profile exploits (2017-2023)
- Total value represented: $2.2B in losses
- Status: Phase 1 complete, 21 more originals to extract

DATA LEAKAGE PREVENTION APPLIED:

All datasets now have annotated/unannotated structure:

annotated/ (Reference Only):
- Full vulnerability documentation
- Descriptive filenames
- Detailed comments marking vulnerabilities
- Attack scenarios and fix recommendations
- Complete metadata in JSON files

unannotated/ (For AI Evaluation):
- Generic sample IDs (sample_1_0001, sample_001.sol, etc.)
- No vulnerability-revealing comments
- No source URLs or author attributions
- Minimal metadata (language, chain, pragma, difficulty tier)
- Clean code without hints

    └── proof_of_concept/  (Euler variants)

NEXT STEPS:

Immediate (Phase 2 - Temporal Contamination):
- Extract remaining 21 pre-cutoff originals (target: 30 total)
- Continue following annotated/unannotated pattern

Later:
- Create variants for famous exploits (renamed, simplified, obfuscated, patched)
- Collect post-cutoff exploits (Sept 2025+)
- Final consolidation and validation

CURRENT STATE:
- Total samples: 253 (239 difficulty stratified + 9 temporal + 5 Euler variants)
- All samples: Annotated + unannotated versions
- Status: Ready for rigorous AI evaluation
- Git commits: 2 commits on feat/task-two-ground-truth-gold-standard branch
